Track name:Dreamland (Remix) Have only used Moog Modular V.2 For this instrumental melody. Tried just for fun te see if it was possible getting good sound. Anyone who maybe has the Arturia Moog Modular V: why does the saw wave of the 2nd oscillator with no modifications sound different than the first oscillator? The first one sound like a normal saw wave while the 2nd osc seems to have like a square sound going on as well. Couldn't find any info on that anywhere. Moog Modular V от Arturia считается одним из самых популярных, среди музыкантов, цифровых синтезаторов эмулирующих модульный принцип. I've recently been using the Moog 15 app a lot on my iPhone and loving it. I've been shopping around to buy an analog synthesizer lately, but the more I use the app, I think that I should just buy an iPad and have an ultra portable digital synth that sounds just as good to me. However, I opened up Modular V that I haven't used in years earlier tonight and I can't believe how good it sounds either! Anyone else who's tried both and has an opinions on their merits other then obviously the Modular.

I have been using a lot of NI Massive and have decided it's time for a new synth. I was sure it would be Serum, since a lot of people seem to use it, it looks really amazing and can make really good sounds. In every top virtual synth list there is, Serum surely would be mentioned. Today I randomly decided to try the Artura Moog Modular V (basically a virtual moog) - a synth I always had but never used since it seems really complicated and confusing compared to all the modern synths like Massive. どうもUGです。 久々のArturiaネタです。 V collectionを買っていろんなシンセを触る人はたくさん いると思いますが、その中でも操作が複雑なシンセサイザー それが、 「MODULAR V」です。 これはパ・・・. arturia moog modular , arturia moog modular, arturia moog modular скачать, arturia moog modular купить, moog modular v, виртуальный инструмент moog modular v, , виртуальный инструмент, moog modular, bob moog, true analog emulation - Arturia. https://www.arturia.com/products/analog-classics/modular-v Thanks.

Arturia's Moog Modular V is an excellent and affordable way to experience the classic Modular Synthesizer. In short, modular synthesis was the birth of analog (and eventually digital) synthesis in which various task specific "modules" were linked together to create musical sounds. One module. Arturia is a French electronics company founded in 1999 and based in Grenoble, France.  Arturia worked with Robert Moog to create the Modular V softsynth. The Modular V uses Arturia's True Analog Emulation (TAE) in an attempt to faithfully reproduce the oscillators. I have recently been getting into the idea of modular, and am curious what modular software solutions you guys would recommend? I am looking for cheapest + most flexible + most future proof (meaning it's supported and updated regularly). I have a Mac + Logic Pro X, and I am not looking for iPad apps I see these three when I search: - Arturia Modular V - Softube Modular - Reaktor Blocks Anyone have any preferences?

I am trying to build my first system, but I feel like I'm lacking in some parts and have little idea of what I'm doing. I'm looking to make ambient patterns that evolve/change over time. I have researched the modules I want and this is what I have so far. Mind you, I only have a basic knowledge of synthesis by playing with digital VIs (Arturia's Modular V, Mini V, Jupiter-8 and other Logic Pro 9 synths) though building an actual modular system greatly interests me.

Ahoy folk, I have been intrigued by the potential of modular synthesis, and would like to explore further with a low commitment in terms of expense. The goal is to find something that enables the modular experience (tracing patches, bringing the modules together in interesting ways). Ideally this would be something with an interface akin to the "east-coast" synthesis approach or Euro-rack. I have two synths already (MicroKorg m1, SH-201) love them both, and am looking for something software. ARTURIA - MODULAR V - USER'S MANUAL 2 Programming: Robert Bocquier Nicolas Bronnec Pierre-Jean Camilieri Thomas Diligent Sylvain Gubian Xavier Oudin. I've owned a Nord Modular since new, and it's always been one of my favourite toys. Of course, it's pretty dated now and there's a lot of stuff it can't do that modern software can. But the user interface is still great. It's so easy to knock up a patch using the prebuilt modules and adding patch cables. I've got Reaktor, but I find the interface quite clunky. You can build some great stuff in it, but it takes so long and such a lot of brain power. It's nothing like as intuitive as the Nord.

I was originally going to post my write-up in the Hangout thread but this post is so long I feel it's better served in its own thread. Apologies for the wall of text! First, it's pretty unfortunate that a lot of big synth names weren't at NAMM. Sequential (edit: see comments below), Moog, Oberheim, and Teenage Engineering were all absent. I was hoping to play a Moog One, the Sirin, and the TE Modular stuff. Oh well.

I apologize if I'm phrasing this confusingly. I have a minilogue currently and a dm12 and drumbrute on the way. I'm interested in adding some semi-modular stuff over the next year - maybe a boog, neutron or crave - and I'd like to have something which can control them all simultaneously. Basically with my current setup I'd like to be able to control sequences for the minilogue, dm12 and drumbrute simultaneously from a single source for live jamming. I'd love whatever I get for that to function. In the past I've considered buying Arturia's V Collection, but the price point of it never really attracted me as it was always jarring, and I could never really pick one out of the group to get individually (except maybe the Modular, but besides the point). So I took the time to calculate, based on the modern prices (a majority of which are Reverb/Ebay listings which are priced up but we're working with the originals , not re-pro's) of each synth, organ, and electric piano in the V Collection.

Hello there, amp#x200B; I am looking to add a wavetable synth to my collection (so far a nice modular / semi-modular combination and Analog Lab 3, which is great for adding a layer here and there, but doesn't offer really deep dives into editing its sounds) due to their sheer flexibility, which impresses the hell out of me!
